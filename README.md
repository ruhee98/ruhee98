## Hi there, I’m Ruhee!

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at WPI, building on my background in Computer Science and Economics from Augustana College, IL. Originally from Kathmandu and now based in Boston, I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and storytelling — whether that’s designing data pipelines, writing about modern data architectures, or experimenting with new tools that bring data to life.

Lately, I’ve been diving into real-time analytics and data engineering — exploring how to connect streaming systems, cloud platforms, and AI/ML to power applications that are both scalable and impactful. For me, it’s as much about problem-solving as it is about shaping ideas into systems people can actually use.

Outside of work and school, I’m a huge fan of independant films 🎬, love watching football ⚽, listening to indie music 🎵, and cooking.
